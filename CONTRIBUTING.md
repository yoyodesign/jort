## Commit messages

We're using the [Conventional Commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for commit message format because it's ace.

A pre-commit hook will prevent you from making commits that don't follow the standard.

A good commit looks like this:

```
docs(contributing): add information about commit message format

re #8
```

You can use Commitizen to help you write a good commit message like so:

```
npm run commit
```
